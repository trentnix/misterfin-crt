 * hardware pass: a 5-minute A/B soak (480x270@8M vs 640x288@12M: both zero
 * dropped frames, zero A/V drift, ~2-3 percentage points apart in total CPU)
 * followed by live sweeps up to 720x576@12M including the worst case (4:3
 * content filling the whole box, ~720x540 decode) — which still left ~60%+
 * of the CPU idle. An old note here claimed 720x576 "pegged the CPU and
 * drifted"; re-measured, that turned out to be an artifact of the UI redraw
 * loop running behind the old measurement, not the decode itself (the
 * dominant vo/scale cost also doesn't grow with source size — decode is the
 * only part that does, 8%->~30% usr from 480x270 to full-box 720x576).
 *
 * Two things this default leans on, both in this file / play():
 * allowVideoStreamCopy=false in jf_stream_url (a 720x576 box would otherwise
 * let a PAL DVD rip stream-copy raw interlaced MPEG-2 — see that comment),
 * and the DAR-aware -vf chain for non-480x270 profiles (heights above the
 * framebuffer must downscale, not overflow). Users on a weak network
 * (12Mbps is ~1.5MB/s, trivial for the wired connection MiSTers normally
 * use) can set 480x270@8000000 in jellyfin.conf to get the old behavior
 * back — those exact dimensions also re-select the original PAL scaling
 * chain (see play()). */
