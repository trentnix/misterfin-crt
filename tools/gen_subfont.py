"""
Generate a smaller mplayer bitmap font for SUBTITLES only (loaded via
mplayer's -subfont, separate from the OSD's -font — see gen_font.py, which
this is a variant of).

The OSD font (gen_font.py) renders font8x8_basic 1:1 scaled (16px). This
one supersamples each glyph at a much higher internal resolution and
box-downsamples it to a smaller target size (13px) for a better-placed
edge than naive nearest-neighbor scaling would give — but still thresholds
to hard 0/255 alpha, same as the OSD font: confirmed on hardware that this
mplayer build's font renderer has no real alpha blending (any nonzero
alpha renders fully opaque), so an actual smooth/antialiased gradient just
fills the whole glyph cell in solid white instead of looking soft.
